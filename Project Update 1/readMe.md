In the proposed Algorithm from the article, Automatic Human Brain Tumor Detection in MRI Image Using Template-Based K Means and Improved Fuzzy C Means Clustering Algorithm, one major component is pre-processing the images. The method for preprocessing includes converting the image into a two dimensional matrix. Then the image is converted to a gray scale image from an rgb image. Next a median filter is applied to the image to eliminate noise. Finally, adjusted, histogram and adaptive histogram based operations are applied to the image to enhance the image.
To complete this task, I extracted the images from the article and converted them to two-dimensional grayscale images with imread() and rgb2gray() in MATLAB. Unfortunately, this is as far as I was able to go, since extracting the images from the paper took longer than expected. Next sprint, I will be sure to spend more time on this project to ensure all steps are completed.
